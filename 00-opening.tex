PAPERS (6 pp. max; 25 min. presentation) Papers describe an educational research project, classroom experience, teaching
technique, curricular initiative, or pedagogical tool. All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant
literature, and contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the interventions, including limitations. Initial submissions must be anonymous.
Note that an ABSTRACT SUBMISSION is now required for all papers and it is due a week before the full paper is due. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item CS Education Research papers should adhere to rigorous standards, describing hypotheses, methods, results, and
limitations as is typical for research studies. These normally focus on topics relevant to computing education with emphasis on
educational goals and knowledge units/topics relevant to computing education with statistical rigor; methods or techniques in
computing education; evaluation of pedagogical approaches; and studies of the many populations engaged in computing
education, including (but not limited to) students, instructors, and issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation.

	\item Experience Reports and Tools papers should carefully describe a computer science education intervention and its context,
and provide a rich reflection on what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why. This track accepts experience reports, teaching
techniques, and pedagogical tools. All papers in this track should provide enough detail for adoption by others.

	\item New Curricula, Programs, Degrees and Position Papers. Papers about curricula, programs and degrees should describe
the motivating context before the new initiative was undertaken, what it took to put the initiative into place, what the impact has
been, and suggestions for others wishing to adopt it. Position papers are meant to engender fruitful academic discussion by
presenting a defensible opinion about a CS education topic, substantiated with evidence.
